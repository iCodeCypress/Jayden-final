                <h3>Spain held Texas for 300 years, and its influence, perhaps filtered through its Latin American
                    colonies, is strongly felt; in reality, though, Spain did little more than raise a few missions and
                    settlements along the coast.</h3>

                <h3>Do you “remember the Alamo”? If so, you might want to consider forgetting it. Or, at least, the
                    version of the story that you think you know.

                    The battle of the Alamo – which took place during the Texas Revolution, when the Mexican army laid
                    siege on a mission for 13 days and hundreds of Texians (as Texas settlers were called) and Tejanos
                    fought them to their deaths – has become a metaphor for American liberty and honor.
                    . </h3>

                <h3>The story, though, is rooted in myth. Some Texas historians have tried to correct it, but
                    conservatives have championed the tale in middle school history books, and even used it to prop up a
                    multi-million dollar Alamo renovation project. GOP leaders detest the so-called “revisionist”
                    narrative so much that they’ve gone so far as to get a virtual event for a new book on the topic
                    canceled</h3>
